WORK IN PROGRESS FOR CLIENT INTERVIEW

1. Enumerate its is used to convert list into enumerated list[(1,value),(2,value)]

2. playing with tuples --> w3schools
Question --> tell me attributes of tuple --> indexed, immutable, allows duplicates, 
	>Some attributes of datasets in python:
		List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
		Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
		Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
		Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members
	> some methods of tuple --> count(5)--> return how many times 5 occurs in tuple
								index(4)--> Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found
	> some good links -->

3. playing with set -->w3schools
Question --> tell me attributes of set --> unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed
	> some methods of set --> add() --> adds an element to set --> why does tuple have this attribute and how does it maintain integrity of unchangeable*
							 copy()--> this gives a copy of set and stores in different memory address.
							 discard()
	>some good links -->
		https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/set/copy
4.playing with string --> its immutable and variable length
	mehods associated -->	str.replace()
							"#".join(iterable list/set/tuple)
							str.split(";")
							str.strip()
							str.isalnum()
							str.isdigit()
							str.isalpha()
							str.index()
							str.islower()
							str.isuppper()
							str.rpartition("banana") --> partition string on last occurence
							

5. playing with lists --> they are mutable as they have function pop now the memory allocation is only for one
6. python 3.0 vs python 2.0 -> some changes in functions, div operator change sourse geeksforgeeks
7.python packages --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urE5MuYd-YM
					  https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/
			some common mistakes of python packaging -->circular dependencies -->hack with infunction imports
														Hidden coupling --> if changes in the code break too many testcases then couling is very high
														Heavy usage of global stage/context
														spageeti code --> loops and lot of nested code
														raviolli code  --> 100's of liitle peices of logic

8.Why python is slow -->Dynamic typing --> no variable has predefined datatype
						Memory Management --> cahching and interpreting is slower than interpreting the byte code
						
9.Context Manager --> it manages setup and teardown of multiple resources

10.A good document stating how to test your code.
	https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/tests/
	
11.palying with dictionaries
	some python stuff --> https://youtu.be/Wkqzl3S2RSk

12. Decorators --> who calls the internal function in side the wrapper function which basically is used as decorator?

13. Handling JSON data with python --> Corey Schafer

14. Map() filter(takes function) reduce() enumerate()
